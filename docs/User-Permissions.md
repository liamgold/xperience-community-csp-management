# User Permissions

This module supports [native Kentico user permissions](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-pages/ui-page-permission-checks). You can assign permissions to users or roles to control who can manage CSP configurations. This was added in version [v4.0.0](https://github.com/liamgold/xperience-community-csp-management/releases/tag/v4.0.0) of the library.
